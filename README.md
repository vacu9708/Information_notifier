## About this program
It is a program that lets you know each time new information is uploaded on webpages you set.

## Why I made this
My friend wanted to be notifed each time webpages that gave informaton of stock market he kept track on manually. I thought it would be good if it could be automated.

## How to use
1. Deal with webpages that require something like login on the web browser that is opened first.
2. Put any name you want in Webpage name box.
